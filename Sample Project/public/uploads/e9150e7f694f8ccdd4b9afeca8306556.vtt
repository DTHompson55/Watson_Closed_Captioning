Hey did Thompson here today we're going to talk about IBM video

1
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.160
transcription on bluemix so

2
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.230
there's a need for transcription of video

3
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.860
libraries of professors talking in front of a class

4
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.380
of students ATA Americans

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.670
with disabilities lawsuits have been increasing so it's really a portent

6
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.030
to get front of this a lot of universities have

7
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.650
dozens or hundreds of thousands of hours of videos that need to be processed

8
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.120
it becomes very costly if you do it up

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.370
by head it's %HESITATION today's being done manually combinations

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.280
dragon perhaps incantation requires

11
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.610
trade workers it's really boring and tedious to pull those videos

12
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.970
together transcripts get misplaced the the

13
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.450
right transcript us get put out to the right video it's just a mess and

14
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.600
hard to keep track of the quality it'd keep track the progress

15
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.650
so it producing

16
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.920
Watson's speech to text no Watson speech to text

17
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.500
yelled about Watson it's that a guy that lives in the cloud

18
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.650
that would jeopardy a few years ago really smart

19
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.800
it takes speech input and produces text output

20
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.070
that supports a eight different languages today I

21
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.530
could support multiple speakers and put labels and for other speakers

22
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.820
to say of who they are it's a cloud based

23
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.040
Watson cognitive service IBM is famous for

24
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.930
its cognitive services it's the highest quality audio

25
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.160
transcription of the industry today very low cost

26
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.380
two cents a minute there's volume discounts go over the pricing

27
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.450
later a first one thousand but it's a free the

28
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.550
big questions are where is your audio and video come from do you have

29
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.850
libraries of video that he transcribed do

30
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.960
you have professors talking in front of classrooms full

31
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.110
of students or some combination of these things

32
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.600
to that how do you want to use that output to simply want to take the output

33
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.010
and move it to a you tube repository

34
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.470
%HESITATION do you want to make it available to students on subscriber's

35
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.480
smart app O. to take care of

36
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.930
it AT a in the classroom so the Zulu

37
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.080
big questions we solve all of those you know what we talk

38
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.630
about an API the cloud it's

39
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.830
a programmer to face you could build an application using

40
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.930
it today we could build it for you with your input

41
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.680
that we have something called the crush method where we build that application

42
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.760
exactly the way you want it IBM business partners

43
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.040
have prepackaged solutions to do all of this and they

44
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.090
want to get into universities today so

45
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.420
they're priced right to get it to the university market we also have

46
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.550
something called the Watson BT a lab but it's far more than most

47
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.840
universities need of it if you using

48
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.030
you to today you might want to think about using the IBM cloud

49
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.040
video service which is a streaming service a lot like YouTube

50
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.640
us the streaming storage it's designed to meet the needs

51
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.700
of businesses and hospitals universities pseudo code

52
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.000
solution %HESITATION closed captions provided

53
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.050
by watts's secede closed caption that we've just been talking about

54
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.810
the main thing is it secured it's hard it's industrialized your

55
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.920
content remains yours it if you don't know what that means

56
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.160
you should read the Google terms of service I rode

57
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.490
a you tube what we're gonna see today

58
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.190
does not rely on a cloud video although you could use it so

59
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.490
let's go and show you a couple demos so

60
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.880
thank you very much for coming Dave it's good to have you here it

61
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.560
is my pleasure Michael glad to be with you how real is

62
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.070
artificial intelligence the question of how real is artificial

63
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.220
intelligence is a complex one don I would

64
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.650
say %HESITATION give if we define

65
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.870
artificial intelligence is the ability of a machine

66
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.300
on itself to so the minister

67
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.330
operate there a couple interesting things you saw that it

68
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.450
had speaker labels for the speaker labels changed as

69
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.560
Watson was able to determine which voice was attached

70
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.120
to a witch sentences which utterances also

71
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.660
as Watson was progressing through each sentence he was using the context

72
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.920
of the sins to pick the correct words goes

73
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.170
through and find its words that a potential matches and that is it builds

74
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.280
out the contents selects the correct word for

75
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.390
this and so it's a very good transcriptions so this is the kind

76
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.680
of transcription that you would see coming out of what's is very typical

77
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.600
it's going to another sample and this is an example of

78
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.730
Emma Watson you know in the Watson from the Harry potter movies

79
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.080
so what we're seeing here is a little bit different

80
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.130
it's going to transcribe the audio but

81
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.310
it's also going to give us some key words %HESITATION and analyze

82
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.380
what's being spoken showed him to lend her voice to

83
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.430
this very important solidarity movement she's

84
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.560
a leading British actor and advocate for gender equality

85
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.250
in her own right she's been involved with the promotion of girls education

86
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.900
for several years that's part of her here and humanitarian

87
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.450
efforts she's visited Bangladesh Zambia

88
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.710
recently returned as we just heard from Uruguay on her

89
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.750
first mission with you when women ladies

90
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.160
and gentlemen please join me in welcoming to this stage are co host

91
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.880
and the UN women global goodwill ambassador Emma

92
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.200
Watson soon she's

93
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.220
a walking up to the stage and screen point out a couple things here Watson

94
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.700
is going in and picking out certain key words that it's detecting

95
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:31.180
in the text when she starts speaking you

96
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.370
excellencies UN secretary

97
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.500
general president of the General

98
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.570
Assembly executive director

99
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.900
of the UN women and distinguished guests

100
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.240
today we are launching a campaign post

101
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.310
up there you can see it's a very good transcription

102
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.920
%HESITATION it's she also speaks in a British accent so it's very important

103
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.040
to be able to take accents into account %HESITATION

104
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.340
and also were picking up these these key words you

105
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.540
might use those key words to to auto indexing of

106
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.180
a video library if people wanted to know abounds

107
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.580
can I find videos on gender equality these key

108
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.860
words could be used for that kind of search criteria thought

109
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.060
it could also be used to find specific points are

110
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.190
in a video so if you had a video

111
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.340
about cats it might say that the cat

112
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.490
was mentioned at three minutes and twenty one seconds and five

113
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.790
minutes and twenty seven seconds so gives you weighted index into

114
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.170
videos as well so those are two key aspects

115
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.410
of speech Texan will show you one more demo to

116
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.680
this is just something I wrote because %HESITATION away

117
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.020
to see how easy it was to use those API's

118
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.200
and write a little program around it says five steps of going

119
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.320
to import a video file a good verify that is

120
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.710
the correct video file wait for Watson to make the transcription

121
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.100
and that review the results and make any any corrections

122
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.520
so let's do this and I just go pick a short

123
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.100
video because it takes as long to transcribe the video %HESITATION

124
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.220
as it does to to play the video I'm pretty much so

125
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.350
this is the video that I selected you see we have a video of you were here

126
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.070
fit play it so robotic process automation imagine

127
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.190
your job that's me %HESITATION talked about robotic

128
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.310
process automation we gotta make some choices here we're gonna say which

129
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.560
languages it and we're going to pick you S. English we're

130
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.900
gonna pick the out put style so there's basically two %HESITATION

131
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.640
captioning outputs Giles VTT ed SRT

132
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.160
your streaming service will tell you to use water the other

133
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.340
utility use a single speakers in multiple speakers so

134
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.860
heavily this choices will submit the

135
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.980
what we're looking at here is just really Watson this is the guts

136
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.470
of how Watson is doing it %HESITATION we've converted the

137
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.110
audio of the video and audio and it

138
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.120
it's done just that quickly about fifteen seconds so now

139
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.150
we go back and play it so robotic process

140
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.350
automation imagine your job is to come in in the morning

141
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.660
so you can see that %HESITATION watts's actually added subtitles to

142
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.940
the video now the the subtitles it added

143
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.020
did not have upper case and lower

144
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.650
case so we're just gonna make Simba case

145
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:23.410
adjustments will add some punctuation adjustments just

146
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:26.420
to show you how that works of it so I'm just going

147
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.700
to submit those updates back

148
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.950
up this is part of how we treat things ed

149
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.290
note we play that's a video it will have a product process

150
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.550
automation imagine your job does updates so again

151
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.990
very easy to %HESITATION to edit and make changes so

152
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.330
those are the three basic ways to use Watson's speech to text

153
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.100
I hope it was informative and %HESITATION did tops
